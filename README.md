# Aim

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly web application that predicts the resale prices of flats in Singapore. This predictive model will be based on historical data of resale flat transactions, and it aims to assist both potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat.

# Approach

The project will involve the following tasks:
#1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: Collect a dataset of resale flat transactions from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB) for the years 1990 to Till Date. Preprocess the data to clean and structure it for machine learning.
#2. Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the dataset, including town, flat type, storey range, floor area, flat model, and lease commence date. Create any additional features that may enhance prediction accuracy.
#3. Model Selection and Training: Choose an appropriate machine learning model for regression (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, or random forests). Train the model on the historical data, using a portion of the dataset for training.
#4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's predictive performance using regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R2 Score.
